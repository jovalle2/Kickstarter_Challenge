# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was to find campaign outocomes based on launch dates and their funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose was to analyze the outcomes based on the launch dates and the outcomes based on goals from this kickstarter challenge data.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Creating a pivot table using parent category, and years as filters. I then filtered columns based on the months in the year and whether they were "successful" "failed" and "canceled".

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After I created a new sheet with some new columns to run some countifs() functions to better get an idea of the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Just starting out the initial pivot table caused some issues into getting everything filtered correctly.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? May was by far the best outcomes in terms of success followed by June. Cancellations seem to stop in October but many of them fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? There is a very high percentalge of failure after going past the 40000 to 44999 mark.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? There is only about 4,000 entries having more data spread accross a wider range of time would give a lot better results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Other things we could create would be seeing more of the other categories and not just theater results.
